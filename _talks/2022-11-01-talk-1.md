This is the outcome of our National Undergraduate Research Training Project. If interested, visit the [summary of this talk](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/a6-1JkS2O1oWdgeuvnpn-w) (*Chinese Website*). <br>

We interviewed 30 Tongqi (gay's wife) and developed a three-stage model that explains the deception and the difficulty of leaving their gay husband. We also challenged the previous belief that the internet is unequivocally beneficial for Tongqi. We also found Tongqi suffered from domestic violence including their husband insulting their outlook, their mother-in-law viewing them as a tool for giving a birth and so on. We share these findings and how they are cheated with Hotarubi in order that they can help womens in that terrible situations.
