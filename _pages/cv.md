# RESEARCH INTERESTS

**Sentencing:** I focus on how to correct biased sentencing. I am also interested in machine learning's potential for biased sentencing correction. 

**Criminal Policy Evaluation:** I am interested in using causal inference to evaluate criminal policies. I  also focus on causal inference with machine learning. 

**Juvenile Justice:** I am interested in why teenagers commit crimes and the correction institution. <br>

# RESEARCH EXPERIENCES

<div><span style="float:right"> 09/2024 - Present</span><b>Research Assistant</b>, 2024 National Social Science Fund Youth Project</div>

- **Project Leader:** Dr. Boyang Xu
- **Advisor:** Dr. Boyang Xu
- **Description:** Previous research on punishment deterrence theory largely focused on the impact of increased punishment on crime rates but seldom looked at the effects of reduced penalties. Moreover, previous studies have also paid great attention to the differential effects of deterrence on different types of crimes. Based on the theories of Lord Shang and Beccaria, we will use China's Plea Bargain pilot system and employ the DID method to discuss the impact of reduced penalties on crime rates and the varying effects of deterrence on different crimes. This study will deepen the understanding of deterrence effects and address the heterogeneity analysis concerns raised by previous scholars. 
- **My Work:** research design; data collection on crime rate and judicial documents; data analysis; literature review on theory frame and Plea Bargain pilot system. 
- **Final Work (expected):** a paper titled "Punishment Leads to Punishment? A Quasi-Experimental Analysis" (*first author*). 
- **Other Information:** this work is expected to end at 09/2025. 

<div><span style="float:right">03/2024 - Present</span><b>Project Leader</b>, Independent Research</div>

- **Sponsor:** CUPL Data Law Lab's Fund for Law Experiment Model (***Grant:** ¥10000*)
- **Advisor:** Dr. Boyang Xu & Dr. Dai Li
- **Description:** Previous sentencing prediction models often overlooked the quality of the datasets used for training. We aimed to use treating like cases alike (*TLCA*) theory and NLP to filter China's judicial documents datasets. By comparing the training results of models before and after filtering, we attempted to discover the potential of criminal justice theory to improve the machine learning model's performance. Our findings indicate that filtering datasets with criminal justice theory can effectively enhance data quality and, consequently, the performance of the trained models. This research plays a significant role in revealing the potential application of social science theories in machine learning. 
- **My Work:** research design; data collection on judicial documents; literature review on TLCA theory; build a stacking model; build rules for feature extraction; draft the manuscript. 
- **Final Work:** a report titled "Empirical Research on Treating Like Cases Alike Can Improve the Performance of Prison Term Prediction Models: A Study Combining Data-Driven and Theory-Driven Approaches" (*first author*). If interested, visit our models' beta version website http://118.25.58.138 (*need translation*). 
- **Other Information**: We attended a model competition and got the first prize. (*rank 4/240, the only undergraduate-led team getting the first prize*). 

<div><span style="float:right">03/2024 - 08/2024</span><b>Research Assistant</b>, Annual Project of China Youth & Children Research Association</div>

- **Project Leader:** Dr. Xuelian Zhao

- **Advosor:** Dr. Dai Li & Dr. Boyang Xu

- **Description:** Discussions on the grading and categorization (GC) system in China's Zhuanmen Schools have been lacking empirical evidence. Social control theory is often used to assess correctional difficulty and determine correction strategies. We utilized data from 3 Zhuanmen Schools in China, employing one-way ANOVA and LSD tests to explore which GC method is more reasonable. We also investigated the pathways among social control theory factors and the relationship between these factors and the severity of behavior using mediation analysis. Our study contributes by offering empirical evidence-based suggestions for the GC system and explores how social control affects the severity of behavior. 
- **My Work:** research design; literature review on PPCP theory and GC system; questionnaire design; conduct surveys in 2 provinces; data analysis; draft the manuscript.
- **Final Work**: a paper titled "Treating Different Delinquent Teens Differently: An Empirical Study on China’s Zhuanmen Schools" (*first author*). I attended an academic forum.

- **Description:** Treating like cases alike is always a pursuit in legal professionals. Prior research has proved the biased relationship between reason writing and sentences. But what legal professionals want to know as well is the relationship between facts, description, and reason writing. Besides, prior research does not prove treating like cases alike from a systematic view. So, I collected 532 robbery judicial documents and developed a method to test the relationship between them using RWMD. This study fills the gap in previous research regarding the principle of treating like cases alike.  
- **Final Work:** an unpublished paper titled "Does China Achieve the Goal of Treating Like Cases Alike? Evidence from the Judicial Documents of China". Another independent research is based on it. 

<div><span style="float:right">09/2022 - 09/2023</span><b>Project Leader</b>, National Undergraduate Research Training Project</div>

- **Sponsor:** Ministry of Finance's Fund for National Undergraduate Training Program (***Grant:** ¥10000*)
- **Advisor:** Dr. Ai Ma
- **Description:** Prior research has examined the plight of Tongqi (*gay's wife*) in a static context, neglecting the dynamic process of their deception. This study put Tongqi in a victim placement, aiming to build a theoretical framework that captures the evolution from marriage deception to truth discovery. Using interviews and questionnaire surveys on 31 Tongqi, we've developed a three-stage model that explains the deception and the difficulty of leaving their gay husband. We also challenged the previous belief that the internet is unequivocally beneficial for Tongqi. 
- **My Work:** research design; literature review on Tongqi; interview 22 Tongqi; draft the manuscript.
- **Final Work:** submit a report titled "How They Know and Escape from the Truth? Research on Tongqi's Cheating Marriage" (*first author*) to the evaluation committee and get a 95/100 score. (*rank 1/101*). <br>
