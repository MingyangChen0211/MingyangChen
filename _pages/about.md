Here is **Mingyang Chen (陈铭阳)**.<br>
<br>
I am an undergraduate law student in China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL). My advisors include [Dr. Dai Li (李代副教授)](http://39.98.154.35:88/daili/) and [Dr. Boyang Xu (许博洋讲师)](http://xssfxy.cupl.edu.cn/info/1018/9420.htm). I will graduate from CUPL next year in 2025. My research interests include Sentencing, Machine Learning in Criminal Justice, Criminal Policy Evaluation and Juvenile Justice. I am now working on 2 projects. One is about the relationship between criminal punishment and crime rate. The other one is about machine learning and judges' decision. <br>
<br>
I am also a big fan of Japanese animations and comics. Below is a list of my favorite creations: Naruto by *Masashi Kishimodo*; Bleach by *Noriaki Kubo*; Burn the Witch by *Noriaki Kubo*; Death Note by *Tsugumi Ohba* & *Takeshi Obata*; Ajin: Demi-human by *Gamon Sakurai*; Samurai Champloo by *Shinichirō Watanabe*; Cyberpunk: Edgerunners by *TRIGGER*; Kamen Rider Black Sun by *Kazuya Shiraishi*. <br>
<br>
I am also interested in card magics. I even create a magic about finding the card by audiences themselves. My favorite magician is [Lu Chen (刘谦)](http://www.lu-chen.com/about.php). You can follow his [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrkUG6HDUXf8tjQdIqP-kIg) here.
